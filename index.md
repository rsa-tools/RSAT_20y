## RSAT 20th anniversary workshop

In 2018, the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools ([RSAT](http://rsat.eu)) software suite celebrates its $20^{th}$ birthday by organising a 1-day workshop in Paris (May 17-18, 2018). 

This Web site presents a 3-hours tutorial to get familiar with RSAT based on a study case where we analyse motifs in plant ChIP-seq peaks. This tutorial is derived from a previously published protocol [@pmid27557775]. The concepts seen here apply to other organisms as well. 

The training session will include be customized based on a discussion with participants about their specific questions and needs.
